# Music-Generation-using-Deep-Learning


This a Colab notebook that has the python code for Music Generation using Deep Learning
So more ruuning the notebook effieciently you will require to collect midi data.
Midi is type or we can say as an extension of a music.
You can download midi sounds from the web.
Collect data of a single genre of music like pop,jazz,rock etc and at once train only a particular genre only
Upload your collectd data to drive if you are using colab notebook or use whatever your method you are using 
and then hit the run button to train your Deep Learning model.

Make sure you have enough data to train your model because more the data the better model will be trained and 
also make sure to have good computational power to train because it takes a lot of time to train and the speed 
will depend on the computational power ,you can also use cloud GPU of colab.

Once the models is trained it will start generating  music and will save it to a path that you have given.
